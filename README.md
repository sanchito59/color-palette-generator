# Color Palette Generator

## By **Chris Sanchez and Noah Horwitz**

[Color Palette Generator](https://sanchito59.github.io/color-palette-generator/) is a work in progress color palette generator built to practice Object Oriented Principles of JavaScript programming. It makes uses of ES6 object class constructors as well as other fundamental programming concepts such as looping and array manipulation through mapping, slicing, etc. The program features the ability to save palettes, read previous palettes, and display those entire palettes as a theme in a webpage mockup. As well, there is conversion from RGB to hex and hex and RGB to provide the user thorough access to information on generated colors. 

Work in progress features include:
- Ruby/Rails rewrite
- Full CRUD
- Database backup
- Display hex and RGB conversion
- 'Locking' colors in unsaved palettes allowing for customization
- Converting color-range colors to the palette object
